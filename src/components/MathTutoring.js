                <h4> My Tutoring Approach:</h4>
                <ul >
                  <li key="1">I teach online via platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and alike (or other platforms suggested by the student). </li>
                  <li key="2">During meeting, I will try to focus on those parts on which the student has weaknesses and help him/her to learn better. </li>
                  <li key="3">If the student wants, we can first have a free half- hour meeting to review the specific subject the student wants to learn.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Also, at university level, I can help student to solve their problems using mathematics software like Maple or Python.  </p>
